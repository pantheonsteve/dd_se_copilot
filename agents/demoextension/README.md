## Configuration

### For Colleagues (Quick Setup)

If you're setting up this extension from a colleague:

1. **Get the config file:** Ask your colleague for `config.js` (contains Supabase credentials)
2. **Place it in the extension folder:** Copy `config.js` to the root of the extension directory
3. **Add your OpenAI API key:** 
   - Open the extension Options page
   - Enter your OpenAI API key in the AI Settings section
   - Each user needs their own OpenAI API key from [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
4. **Reload the extension** in `chrome://extensions/`

### Setting Up From Scratch

If you're setting up cloud sync for the first time:

1. **Copy the config template:**
   ```bash
   cp config.example.js config.js
   ```

2. **Edit `config.js`** with your Supabase credentials:
   ```javascript
   const DEMOBUDDY_CONFIG = {
     // Supabase (for cloud sync & auth)
     SUPABASE_URL: 'https://your-project.supabase.co',
     SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: 'your-anon-key',
     
     // App Settings
     APP_NAME: 'DemoBuddy',
     APP_VERSION: '1.2.0',
   };
   ```

3. **Reload the extension** in `chrome://extensions/`

> ⚠️ **Important:** Never commit `config.js` to git! It's already in `.gitignore`. Share it with colleagues through secure channels (e.g., encrypted message, 1Password, etc.)

### Getting API Keys

| Service | Where to Get Keys |
|---------|-------------------|
| Supabase | [supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard) → Project Settings → API |
| OpenAI (for AI features) | [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) |

### Cloud Sync Setup (Optional)

For full cloud sync functionality, see **[SUPABASE_SETUP.md](SUPABASE_SETUP.md)** for:
- Database schema setup
- Edge Functions deployment

## Usage

### Opening the Talk Track Window

1. Navigate to any Datadog page
2. Click the extension icon in your toolbar
3. A separate popup window will open showing your talk tracks
4. The window will automatically update as you navigate between tabs
5. Hide the popup window during screen sharing to keep your notes private

**Pro Tip:** Position the popup window on a separate monitor or in a corner where you can reference it easily during presentations without it appearing in screen shares.

### Using AI Generation

**Basic Flow:**
1. Click **🤖 AI Mode** in the popup window
2. Select a persona (Sales Engineer, Solutions Architect, etc.)
3. Click **📸 Capture & Generate**
4. Wait 10-30 seconds for AI to analyze the page
5. Review the generated talk track
6. Choose how to save:
   - **💾 Save as New** - Create a new track
   - **➕ Append to Existing** - Add to current track (great for multi-section pages!)
   - **🔄 Replace Existing** - Refresh existing track content

**Multi-Section Strategy:**
For pages with multiple sections, generate content for each section and append:
1. Show top section → Generate → Save as New
2. Scroll to next section → Generate → Append to Existing  
3. Repeat for all sections → Result: One comprehensive track!

**See AI-FEATURES.md for complete AI documentation**

### Inline Authoring (New! ✏️)

Create and edit talk tracks directly from the popup window while exploring your demo:

**Creating a New Track:**
1. Navigate to a page you want to annotate
2. Click the **✏️** button in the popup header
3. Or click **✏️ Create Talk Track** when no track exists
4. Fill in the form:

2. Make your changes
3. Click **💾 Save Changes**

**Real-Time URL Pattern Validation:**
- As you type the URL pattern, you'll see:
  - ✅ **Green** - Pattern matches current page
  - ❌ **Red** - Pattern does NOT match current page
- Use the suggestion buttons:
  - **📍 Auto-detect** - Generate pattern from current URL
  - **🔗 Exact path** - Match this exact page

**Quick Workflow:**

2. See something important → Click ✏️
3. Write your talking points
4. Check URL validation is ✅
5. Save → Done!

### Configuring Base URL

Demo Buddy works with any website, but you can configure a base URL to help with URL pattern suggestions and AI context:

1. Open the **Options** page
2. Find the **⚙️ General Settings** section at the top
3. Enter your base URL or click a **quick preset**:
   - **Datadog US1:** `https://app.datadoghq.com`
   - **Datadog US3:** `https://us3.datadoghq.com`
   - **Datadog US5:** `https://us5.datadoghq.com`

2. Or click "Configure Talk Tracks" in the popup window

### WYSIWYG Editor & Google Docs Integration

The talk track editor is now **WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get)** by default, making it easy to format content without learning markdown syntax.

**Key Features:**
- **Rich Text Editing** - Bold, italic, underline, lists, headings appear formatted as you type
- **Copy from Google Docs** - Paste formatted content directly, preserving:
  - Bold, italic, underline formatting
  - Bulleted and numbered lists (including nested lists)

- **Toolbar Buttons** - Click buttons or use keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+B, Ctrl+I, Ctrl+U)
- **Markdown Toggle** - Click "📝 View Markdown" to see/edit raw markdown source
- **Auto-Save** - Content converts to markdown for storage automatically

**Workflow Example:**
1. Write your talk track in Google Docs
2. Format it with bold, lists, headings, etc.
3. Copy from Google Docs (Ctrl+C / Cmd+C)
4. Paste into talk track editor (Ctrl+V / Cmd+V)
5. Formatting is preserved automatically!
6. Edit inline with WYSIWYG tools
7. Click "Save" - content stored as markdown

**Advanced Users:**

### Backup & Recovery

Your talk tracks are valuable! The extension automatically protects your work:

**Automatic Backups:**
- A backup is created **every time you save**
- Up to 50 backups are kept (oldest deleted first)
- Backups include all tracks, categories, and metadata

**Restoring from Backup:**
1. Click **📂 Restore** button at bottom of Options page
2. Browse backup history (sorted newest first)
3. Click **↩️ Restore** on any backup
4. Confirm restoration (current state is backed up first)
5. All tracks restored to that point in time!

**Exporting Backups:**
- Click **📤 Export** on any backup to download as JSON
- Or click **📤 Export Current Tracks** for current state
- JSON files can be imported later via Import function

**Data Loss Warning:**
If the system detects potential content truncation during save:
- You'll see a warning dialog
- A backup has already been created
- You can cancel save and investigate
- Or confirm to proceed with save

**Best Practices:**
- Use **📂 Restore** to view backup history regularly
- Export important tracks to JSON files for off-browser backup
- If something looks wrong after save, restore immediately
- Check track content in "View Markdown" mode if unsure

### Managing Categories

The extension includes default categories (Dashboards, APM, Logs, etc.) but you can create your own:

1. Open the **Options** page
2. Scroll to **🤖 AI Talk Track Generation** section
3. Find the **Custom Categories** area at the bottom
4. Click **+ Add Custom Category**
5. Enter category name (e.g., "Customer Demos", "Training", "Webinars")
6. Your custom category now appears in:
   - Category filter dropdown
   - Track category selector
   - Bulk actions menu

**Category Features:**
- **Edit** - Rename categories (automatically updates all tracks)
- **Delete** - Remove categories (moves tracks to "Other")
- **Auto-colors** - Each custom category gets a unique color
- **Track count** - See how many tracks use each category

### URL Pattern Examples

- `*/dashboards/*` - Matches any dashboard page
- `*/apm/services` - Matches the APM services page
- `*/monitors/manage` - Matches the monitors management page
- `*app.datadoghq.com/infrastructure*` - Matches infrastructure pages

You can use `*` as a wildcard to match any text.

## Tips for Creating Talk Tracks

1. **Be specific with URL patterns** - More specific patterns will match first
2. **Use Markdown formatting** - Make important points stand out with bold, bullets, and headings
3. **Include key metrics** - Add specific numbers or data points to reference
4. **Add transitions** - Include phrases to smoothly move between topics
5. **Keep it concise** - Presenter notes should be quick reference, not full scripts
